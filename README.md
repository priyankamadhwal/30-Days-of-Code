#### Day 1: Data Types  
**Task**   
The variables i, d, and s are already declared and initialized for you. You must:  
- Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.  
- Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.  
- Use the + operator to perform the following operations: 
1. Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.  
2. Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.  
3. Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.  
**Input Format**  
The first line contains an integer that you must sum with i. 
The second line contains a double that you must sum with d. 
The third line contains a string that you must concatenate with s.  
**Output Format**  
Print the sum of both integers on the first line, the sum of both doubles (scaled to 1 decimal place) on the second line, 
and then the two concatenated strings on the third line.  
#### Day 2: Operators    
**Task**   
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.  
**Input Format**  
There are 3 lines of numeric input:  
The first line has a double, mealCost (the cost of the meal before tax and tip).  
The second line has an integer, tipPercent (the percentage of mealCost being added as tip).  
The third line has an integer, taxPercent (the percentage of mealCost being added as tax).  
**Output Format**  
 Print The total meal cost is totalCost dollars., where totalCost is the rounded integer result of the entire bill (mealCost with added tax and tip).
